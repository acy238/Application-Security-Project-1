Note that github actions on main directory has been updated to test/run the giftcard files mentioned below in this directory, part3.
    Github actions might have reached monthly limit.
 
First, the program was compiled with coverage in terminal with these flags/options:
-> gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -o gcreader gcreader.c
We have our program (gcreader) created, in addition with this file titled: "gcreader.gcno"

Next, test files titled: crash1.gft and crash2.gft, were ran with the program:
-> ./gcreader 1 crash1.gft
-> ./gcreader 2 crash1.gft
-> ./gcreader 1 crash2.gft
-> ./gcreader 2 crash2.gft
After running these commands above for our program (gcreader), this file was also created: "gcreader.gcda"

Upon running code coverage tool on the compiled giftcard reader and test files from part2 folder (crash1.gft and crash2.gft) - 
-> gcov -b -c gcreader.c
The results from running this command above are below:
    Lines executed:71.43% of 175
    Branches executed:87.88% of 66
    Taken at least once:59.09% of 66
    gcreader.c:creating 'gcreader.c.gcov'
If needed, details can be seen with this command:
-> cat gcreader.c.gcov

The portions of the program that are not covered were detailed; 2 lines of code were picked and test files were created for each line of code to be covered.
The additional giftcards are titled cov1.gft and cov2.gft; the specifics of each test file are detailed below: 
    cov1.gft: 
        This test file giftcard has a record of type "1" because "crash1.gft" & "crash2.gft" were both giftcards with records of type "2" and type "3".
        This change causes the program to run the block of code that starts at line 246 of "giftcardreader2.c" from folder "part2".
        The block of code at line 246 starts with: if (gcrd_ptr->type_of_record == 1) {...};
    cov2.gft:
        This is a test file giftcard with record of type "3" and this is similar to crash2.gft but there is an important difference.
        The difference here is that the program for the THX-1138 assembly interpreter is 0x10 and not 0x09. 
        This difference causes the program to run the block of code that starts at line 62 of "giftcardreader2.c" from folder "part2".
        This line of code at line 62 starts with: if (zf) pc += (char)arg1;
Upon running code coverage tool on the compiled giftcard reader and test files from part3 folder (cov1.gft and cov2.gft) - the results are below:
    Lines executed:84.57% of 175
    Branches executed:96.97% of 66
    Taken at least once:71.21% of 66

The additional giftcards are titled fuzzer1.gft and fuzzer2.gft; the specifics of each test file are detailed below: 
    fuzzer1.gft:
        This test file giftcard has a record of type "2" and does not allocate enough memory, only 116 bytes is allocated.
    fuzzer2.gft:
        This test file giftcard has a record of type "2" and does not allocate enough memory, but states 76 giftcard records when there is only 1. 
        This test file giftcard also calls animate() by specifying type "3" record when it has only 1 record of type "2". 
The "giftcardreader3.c" file in part3 folder has been updated to check that if a giftcard record is of type "2" then it must have atleast 32+256 bytes;
